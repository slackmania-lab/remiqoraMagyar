#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
Clones the original ACE-Step-1.5 and audio.cpp (YuE2) repositories into
external/, applies Remiqora's small patches on top (see
external/patches/README.md), builds/prepares each engine, sets up a
Demucs (stem separation) uv project in external/Demucs, and writes
backend/.env with all of the above plus an auto-detected FFMPEG_BIN_DIR.

Re-run any time - every step is idempotent (skips work that is already done).

# Not an upstream repo to clone - just a throwaway uv project with the

# practice:
#  1. A bare "uv add demucs" resolves torch from plain PyPI, which on
#     Windows is a CPU-only wheel - stem separation would silently run on
#     CPU instead of alongside the GPU model like the UI expects. Routing
#     "torch" at PyTorch's own cu128 wheel index below (same index
#     ACE-Step-1.5's own pyproject.toml uses) fixes that.
#  2. "uv init"'s default requires-python tracks whatever Python is newest
#     on the machine, which can be newer than what PyTorch's cu128 wheels
#     support yet - uv then falls back to the CPU wheel again, silently.
#     Pinning requires-python to ACE-Step-1.5's own range sidesteps that.
# `numpy` is listed explicitly too: demucs imports it directly (see
# demucs/transformer.py) but its own package metadata doesn't declare it as
# a dependency, so it's otherwise missing and demucs fails to import.
